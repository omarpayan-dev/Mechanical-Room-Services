    <h2>Hi, I'm Omar</h2>
    <p>I started my career in the U.S. Air Force, where I developed the discipline, technical expertise, and dedication that now drive my business. For over 12 years, Iâ€™ve been honing my skills as a mechanical professional, working on everything from massive commercial boilers to advanced chiller systems and hydronic loops.</p>
    <p>When I transitioned into private industry, I brought with me a passion for solving complex problems and a deep understanding of mechanical systems. My clients range from schools and hospitals to industrial plants and government facilities, all with unique challenges that require tailored solutions. I approach each project as a partnership, collaborating with you to deliver long-lasting results.</p>
    <h3>Why I Do This Work</h3>
    <p>I believe that reliable mechanical systems are the backbone of every successful operation. When your boilers, chillers, and cooling towers work seamlessly, your business or facility can focus on what matters most. My goal is to take the stress out of system management, ensuring everything runs like clockwork.</p>
